This tool will create packets to send to the service to create SNP Resources. Note If you use the production version it fires the packet to the prod service which copies the packet and sends it to the QA system. This means when you add a machine to prod it adds it to both QA and prod. if you add a machine twice you end up with two entries in the Machine Info Table. to fix a double entry you can remove one of them but make sure it is the one with the Machine ID that doesnt corelate with the existing data.
